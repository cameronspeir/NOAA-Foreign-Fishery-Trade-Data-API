# NOAA-Foreign-Fishery-Trade-Data-API
Contains examples of how to filter and download fishery product import and export data using the API

This repository contains examples of how to accesss the foreign fishery trade data programmatically using an API.  

The main landing page for this data set is here:
https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/national/sustainable-fisheries/foreign-fishery-trade-data

I hope this helps people access and use the data.  Feel free to contact me or create a pull request if you have any comments or questions.  

I want to thank Sofia Reardon for explaining the basics of the query syntax to me.  

As of this writing (8/18/2020), I have only included examples using R; specifically, using the httr and jsonlite packages.  Eventually, I would also like to figure out how to access the data set using Stata.  If you have ideas on how to do this, please share with me and your colleagues!
